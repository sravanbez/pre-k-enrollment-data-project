Submission Instructions: 
1. Provide a Git repository link containing your code. - https://github.com/sravanbez/pre-k-enrollment-data-project/tree/main 
2. Provide a SQL query that will answer this question: 
    a. In 2021, which 10 states had the highest number of children enrolled in Pre-K? 
    SELECT state AS state_name, SUM(enrollment) AS total_enrollment
    FROM spectrum_schema.pre_k_enrollment_data
    WHERE year = 2021
    GROUP BY state
    ORDER BY total_enrollment DESC
    LIMIT 10;
3. Answer the following questions: 
    a. Please list all tools and technologies you used to complete this assignment. 
        The list of Tools used for this assignement are 
        Visual Studio Code, 
        AWS free tier account - S3 bucket, AWS Lambda, AWS Glue, Redshift Spectrum, Amazon EventBridge, AWS IAM
        Python libs - Boto3, Requests
        Postman 
b. Explain your rationale for your approach to this task. 
    My approach was to create a solution which is frugal (cost-effective), automated, fault-tolerant, 
    scalable and easy to maintain and handles data ingestion (Lambda), storage(s3) and querying effectively (Glue, Spectrum, data catalogs). 
    It also supports scheduling and orchestration (cloudwatch events) as well. 
C. What else would you do if you had more time? 

If I had more time, I wouldnâ€™t limit myself to Pre-K enrollment data. 
I would also focus on streamlining education data holistically and create dedicated dashboards on AWS QuickSight 
for metrics like enrollment, discipline and incidents, harassment or bullying, chronic absenteeism, restraint and seclusion, 
state assessments, teachers and staff, and other relevant data available in the education portal. 
I would name this initiative the Education 360 Metrics Project, which would provide an end-to-end, 
one-stop solution for all education-related analytics.

Along with the Data analytics, I would also extract all the relevant source objects and run multiple analytics on the 
enrollment data, segmented across various data cohorts. Additionally, I would explore incorporating a machine learning 
component using AWS SageMaker to develop metrics and models based on the enrollment data segmented by grade, race, sex,
 and geographical location.
